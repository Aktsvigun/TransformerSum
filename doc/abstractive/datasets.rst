Abstractive Supported Datasets
==============================

All of the summarization datasets from the `huggingface/nlp <https://github.com/huggingface/nlp>`_ library are supported. Only 4 options (specifically ``--dataset``, ``--dataset_version``, ``--data_example_column``, and ``--data_summarized_column``) have to be changed to train a model on a new dataset.

The most notable datasets (the ones pertaining to summarization) are listed below.

* ``cnn_dailymail``
* ``redit_tifu``
* ``newsroom``
* ``reddit``
* ``multi_news``
* ``gigaword``
* ``billsum``
* ``wikihow``
* ``scientific_papers``
* ``xsum``
* ``opinosis``

The `live nlp viewer <https://huggingface.co/nlp/viewer>`_ visualizes the data and describes each dataset.
