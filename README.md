## Pre-trained Models

All pre-trained models (including larger models and other architectures) are located in `the documentation <https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_. The below is just a small fraction of the available models.

## Install

Installation is made easy due to conda environments. Simply run this command from the root project directory: `conda env create --file environment.yml` and conda will create and environment called `transformersum` with all the required packages from [environment.yml](environment.yml). The spacy `en_core_web_sm` model is required for the [convert_to_extractive.py](convert_to_extractive.py) script to detect sentence boundaries.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/HHousen/transformersum.git`.
2. Change to project directory: `cd transformersum`.
3. Run installation command: `conda env create --file environment.yml`.
4. **(Optional)** If using the [convert_to_extractive.py](convert_to_extractive.py) script then download the `en_core_web_sm` spacy model: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`.
